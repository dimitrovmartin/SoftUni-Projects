    "\n",
    "First, you can double-click each cell and edit its content. If you want to run a cell (that is, execute the code inside it), use Cell > Run Cells in the top menu or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each cell has a type. There are two main types: Markdown (which is for any kind of free text, explanations, formulas, results... you get the idea), and code (which is, well... for code :D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a...\n",
    "#### Quick Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "##### Text and Paragraphs\n",
    "There are several things that you can do. As you already saw, you can write paragraph text just by typing it. In order to create a new paragraph, just leave a blank line. See how this works below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",

    "There are six levels of headings. Level one is the highest (largest and most important), and level 6 is the smallest. You can create headings of several types by prefixing the header line with one to six \"#\" symbols (this is called a pound sign if you are ancient, or a sharp sign if you're a musician... or a hashtag if you're too young :D).

    "\n",
    "##### Emphasis\n",
    "You can create emphasized (stronger) text by using a **bold** or _italic_ font. You can do this in several ways (using asterisks (\\*) or underscores (\\_)). In order to \"escape\" a symbol, prefix it with a backslash (\\). You can also strike through your text in order to signify a correction.\n",

    "### * Problem 7. Solving Equations Graphically\n",
    "Now that we have a general plotting function, we can use it for more interesting things. Sometimes we don't need to know what the exact solution is, just to see where it lies. We can do this by plotting the two functions around the \"=\" sign ans seeing where they intersect. Take, for example, the equation $2x + 3 = 0$. The two functions are $f(x) = 2x + 3$ and $g(x) = 0$. Since they should be equal, the point of their intersection is the solution of the given equation. We don't need to bother marking the point of intersection right now, just showing the functions.\n",

    "### Problem 8. Trigonometric Functions\n",
    "We already saw the graph of the function $y = \\sin(x)$. But, how do we define the trigonometric functions once again? Let's quickly review that.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"angle-in-right-triangle.png\" style=\"max-height: 200px\" alt=\"Right triangle\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The two basic trigonometric functions are defined as the ratio of two sides:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And also:\n",
    "$$ \\tan(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cot(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{opposite}} = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine, but using this, \"right-triangle\" definition, we're able to calculate the trigonometric functions of angles up to $90^\\circ$. But we can do better. Let's now imagine a circle centered at the origin of the coordinate system, with radius $r = 1$. This is called a \"unit circle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"triangle-unit-circle.png\" style=\"max-height: 300px\" alt=\"Trigonometric unit circle\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see exactly the same picture. The $x$-coordinate of the point in the circle corresponds to $\\cos(\\alpha)$ and the $y$-coordinate - to $\\sin(\\alpha)$. What did we get? We're now able to define the trigonometric functions for all degrees up to $360^\\circ$. After that, the same values repeat: these functions are **periodic**: \n",
    "$$ \\sin(k.360^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\sin(\\alpha), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(k.360^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, of course, use this picture to derive other identities, such as:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(90^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important property of the sine and cosine is that they accept values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ and produce values in the range $[-1; 1]$. The two other functions take values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ **except when their denominators are zero** and produce values in the same range. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radians\n",
    "A degree is a geometric object, $1/360$th of a full circle. This is quite inconvenient when we work with angles. There is another, natural and intrinsic measure of angles. It's called the **radian** and can be written as $\\text{rad}$ or without any designation, so $\\sin(2)$ means \"sine of two radians\".\n",
    "![Radian definition](radian.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's defined as *the central angle of an arc with length equal to the circle's radius* and $1\\text{rad} \\approx 57.296^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the circle circumference is $C = 2\\pi r$, therefore we can fit exactly $2\\pi$ arcs with length $r$ in $C$. The angle corresponding to this is $360^\\circ$ or $2\\pi\\ \\text{rad}$. Also, $\\pi rad = 180^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some people prefer using $\\tau = 2\\pi$ to avoid confusion with always multiplying by 2 or 0.5 but we'll use the standard notation here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** All trigonometric functions in `math` and `numpy` accept radians as arguments. In order to convert between radians and degrees, you can use the relations $\\text{[deg]} = 180/\\pi.\\text{[rad]}, \\text{[rad]} =  \\pi/180.\\text{[deg]}$. This can be done using `np.deg2rad()` and `np.rad2deg()` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse trigonometric functions\n",
    "All trigonometric functions have their inverses. If you plug in, say $\\pi/4$ in the $\\sin(x)$ function, you get $\\sqrt{2}/2$. The inverse functions (also called, arc-functions) take arguments in the interval $[-1; 1]$ and return the angle that they correspond to. Take arcsine for example:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin(y) = x: sin(y) = x $$\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is NOT entirely correct. From the relations we found:\n",
    "$$\\sin(x) = sin(2k\\pi + x), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "it follows that $\\arcsin(x)$ has infinitely many values, separated by $2k\\pi$ radians each:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 2k\\pi, k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, however, we're interested in the first value (when $k = 0$). It's called the **principal value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: There are inverse functions for all four basic trigonometric functions: $\\arcsin$, $\\arccos$, $\\arctan$, $\\text{arccot}$. These are sometimes written as $\\sin^{-1}(x)$, $\\cos^{-1}(x)$, etc. These definitions are completely equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just notice the difference between $\\sin^{-1}(x) := \\arcsin(x)$ and $\\sin(x^{-1}) = \\sin(1/x)$."

    "We can generate noise in however many dimensions we want. For example, if we want to generate a single dimension, we just pick N random values and call it a day. If we want to generate a 2D noise space, we can take an approach which is similar to what we already did with `np.meshgrid()`.\n",

    "4. Test and improve the algorithm\n",
    "5. (Optional) Create a cool demo :), e.g. using Perlin noise to simulate clouds. You can even do an animation (hint: you'll need gradients not only in space but also in time)\n",
    "6. Communicate the results (e.g. in the Softuni forum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: [This](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) is a very good resource. It can show you both how to organize your notebook (which is important) and how to implement the algorithm."
